            <!-- <p>Far far away, behind the word mountains, far from the countries Vokalia and Consonantia, there live the blind texts. Separated they live in Bookmarksgrove right at the coast of the Semantics</p> -->
            <!-- <p>Our research currently focuses on the role of quantum information in quantum gravity and in relativistic field theory. Key topics include quantum black holes, holographic entropy bounds, and the fundamental relation between energy and information. </p> -->

          <p>Our research currently focuses on the role of quantum information in quantum gravity and in relativistic field theory. Key topics include quantum black holes, holographic entropy bounds, and the fundamental relation between energy and information. </p>
          <p>We are located in the <a href="http://ctp.berkeley.edu/">Berkeley Center for Theoretical Physics </a></p>

          <p>For a list of works that the group is thinking about, check our <a href="/references">references</a> page.</p>

          <p>If you'd like to chat in person, stop by the 4th floor of Old LeConte on Wednesdays at 12:40p. You can also find us chatting around the lunch table most days.</p>
