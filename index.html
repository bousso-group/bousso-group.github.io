          <p>Our research currently focuses on the role of quantum information in quantum gravity and in relativistic field theory. Key topics include quantum black holes, holographic entropy bounds, and the fundamental relation between energy and information. We are also interested in cosmology and the string theory landscape.</p>

          <p>For a list of works that the group is thinking about, check our <a href="/references">references</a> page.</p>

          <p>If you'd like to chat in person, stop by the 4th floor of Old LeConte on Wednesdays at 12:40p. You can also find us chatting around the lunch table most days.</p>

          <p> Our research is supported by the National Science Foundation and by the <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/geoflow/home">Department of Energy</a>. To help support our students, visitor program, and postdocs, please consider the giving opportunities to the <a href="http://ctp.berkeley.edu/giving.html">Berkeley Center for Theoretical Physics</a>.</p>
