                Our usual seminar time is 3:40pm on Tuesdays. Occasionally they happen on Wednesdays at 3:40pm. Our seminars are in a hybrid format - in person in Physics South 402, as local public health guidelines permit, and always streamed via Zoom. The Zoom link is <a href="https://berkeley.zoom.us/j/370438207">here</a>. (Note that you must be logged in to be able to join the meeting.) For all previously recorded talks, you may browse the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBpJej3l8l7mM594oKUxgxA">YouTube Channel</a>.

                The calendar for seminars hosted by the theory group can be found <a href="https://www-theory.lbl.gov/wordpress/?page_id=6741">here</a>. Look for the green slots in the calendar for the string-related events.
