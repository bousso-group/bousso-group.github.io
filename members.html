                I am interested in quantum gravity and cosmology. My research focuses on the deep role that quantum information plays in these settings. According to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bousso%27s_holographic_bound">covariant entropy bound</a>, the geometry of spacetime is closely related to its information content. We have sharpened and strengthened this "holographic" relation in recent years. Though strictly a hypothesis about quantum gravity, entropy bounds have become a discovery tool that is yielding new, provable features of relativistic quantum field theory, such as the quantum null energy condition. These and related insights have led to fruitful interactions with quantum information theory and condensed matter physics. They also have useful applications to benchmarking current quantum computing platforms. I lead <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/geoflow/home">GeoFlow</a>, a multi-institutional consortium of theorists and experimentalists working at the interface of these areas.

                Brief bio: I grew up in southern Germany. (I was born and have family in Israel but never lived there.) When I was little, I thought math was interesting, and I still do. But I decided instead to try to figure out how the universe works. I studied with Stephen Hawking in Cambridge, and I spent postdoc years at Stanford, KITP (Santa Barbara), and Harvard, before joining UC Berkeley as faculty (since 2003).

                My research focusses on using ideas from the theory behind quantum computers (and, more generally, quantum information) in order to make progress in our understanding of the quantum mechanics of gravity. In particular, I have recently been working on understanding how the information that falls into a black hole ends up being encoded in the Hawking radiation left behind after the black hole evaporates.

                My main research interest is in understanding the connections between quantum mechanics, quantum information, and black hole physics. In my current work, I am approaching these questions from different perspectives, primarily utilizing lower-dimensional gravitation toy models such as Jackiw-Teitelboim gravity. I am working to understand the implications of generalized theories of gravity for the thermodynamics properties and quantization of the dimensionally reduced theories. In addition, I am investigating how properties of entanglement entropy could emerge from a Hilbert space construction in the two dimensional gravity system. Additionally, I am interested in understanding de Sitter physics in lower dimensions from a detailed Lorentzian path integral approach. My past work focused on the concept of circuit complexity in high energy physics. I developed toy models for complexity in field theory and further developed the properties of the proposals for the gravitational dual of complexity in the CFT. As an extension of this work, I aim to understand in more detail the connection between exponentially long saturation of complexity and very long wormholes in quantum gravity.

                Basic questions that drive me include the following: How can we use quantum computers to learn more about quantum physics? How can we accelerate the usefulness of quantum computers? Can black holes be simulated by tabletop experiments involving everyday atoms?
